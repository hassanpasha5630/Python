#Design and Develop an aggregator in python which aggregates news / articles on â€œdiabetes" and converts the content to be published on the kitchry platform. 
#This data model will be used as a subscription service to the clients who are diabetic. 
#The deliverable should be a working prototype. Feel free to define constraints and #assumptions as you see fit. Coding required.


#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The code below will go to any news related website, cnn is a pre-added one you can always add more.
# It will than display the categories that are for the selected website. You can select one and it will 
# continue to give you all the articles referring to the category. you can filter it more with a desired 
# keyword as well which is commented out below. Please check that section of the code. It will 
# take the text and throw it on to a GUI for easy read. The GUI was referenced from the website that is 
# listed above that section of the code.
